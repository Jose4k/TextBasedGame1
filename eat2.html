                You are hungry and so you dig in, but when you look up you see your date being surprised 
                 because she wanted to take some pictures for her social media. She looks disappointed
                 because she wanted to take a picture of your meals.
                There is nothing you can do now, though she still got her picture. 
            </p>
            <p>
            After a little while both of you are done eating and talking. 
            The waiter comes around and asks if you would like dessert. 
            You splurged a little too much on dinner so should you get dessert or skip on it?
            </p>
