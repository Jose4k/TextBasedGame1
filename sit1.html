           <p>She sits down and so do you. 
               You quickly realize that you should have been more gentleman-like and should have helped her with her things. 
               You also could have complimented her. But there is nothing you can do now.
        </p>

        <p>
            As both of you are seated a waiter comes by with glasses of water. 
            As he gets to your table he trips and spills water on to you.
             You are low key embarrassed so now what do you do?
