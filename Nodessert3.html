        As you talk with your date you decide to skip dessert and your date seems a little disappointed (But what can they do) so you ask the waiter for the bill. The waiter brings the bill to you and thankfully you are able to afford the dinner. So you both get up and walk to the exit. You think to yourself  how you did.

      <p>
          The date comes to an end.
