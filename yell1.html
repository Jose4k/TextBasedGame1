                You got very embarrassed and decided to yell at the waiter. 
                The waiter sincerely apologizes as he cleans up the mess. 
                Your date thinks that it was a little harsh but you continue on. 
                The waiter then finishes up and goes back to send a new waiter to their table. 
            </p>
            <p>
               As you chat to your date about the situation that just happened a new  waiter comes  up and asks
               “What will you be having tonight?”
