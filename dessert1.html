                You decide to get the dessert, and you slowly realize that perhaps you may not have enough money to pay for the dessert and the dinner together. 
                So you kindly ask if she could help you pay for the dessert as well. The dont seem to be bothered by the proposition but ofcourse you could have gotten bonus points for paying it all youself.

            </p>
            <p>
                As both of you finish your dessert you ask the waiter to bring you the bill ofcourse you couldn't pay it all but it was a nice meal eaither way.
            </p>
            <p>finally the date comes to an end. </p>
