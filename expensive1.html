                You wanted to go all out and impress your date so you get an expensive meal and you tell her she can as well. She agrees and you guys choose an expensive meal. She seems happy about the offer. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The waiter comes by while you guys are talking and brings you your food. Up until this point you have waited a while because of the prior incident. Do you begin eating?
