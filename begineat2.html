                You are hungry and so you dig in, but when you look up you see your date being surprised  because she wanted to take some pictures for her social media. She looks disappointed because she wanted to take a picture of your meals. There is nothing you can do now, though she still got her picture.

                After a little while both of you are done eating and talking. The waiter comes around and asks if you would like dessert. Luckily you didn't break the bank earlier so you are able to afford a decent dessert. But you can decide for yourself if you want to order it or not.
