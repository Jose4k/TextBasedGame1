                You chose to  take your date to a semi fancy restaurant. 
                You ask her out to the restaurant.
                She likes the idea and you will meet at the restaurant. 
                You arrive at the restaurant and the host greets you and takes you to your table.
                You are about to sit down, what do you do?
