                You are hungry but you decide to wait, and as you wait you see your date pull out their phone and they begin to take pictures of the food. 
                You see them as they smile while you perpetually die of hunger. But seeing them happy makes you happy. (So eh)
            </p>
            <p>
            After a little while both of you are done eating and talking. 
            The waiter comes around and asks if you would like dessert. 
            You splurged a little too much on dinner so should you get dessert or skip on it?
